    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
    Ready in about 45 minutes, tonkatsu curry is an easy dish bursting with flavor. Simple ingredients and easy techniques is all it takes to create a family-pleasing meal that everyone will love!

    Tonkatsu, also called pork katsu, is a Japanese dish of thinly sliced, breaded, and fried pork. Coated in panko breadcrumbs, the pork is golden brown and crunchy on the outside while staying moist and tender inside. 

    Tonkatsu is the official name when this dish is made with pork, but you can also find chicken katsu with chicken breast or chicken thighs or ‘ahi katsu. A tonkatsu sauce usually accompanies it, and this katsu curry dish is a succulent and flavorful curry that’s loaded with tender-crisp carrots and potatoes.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Tonkatsu Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pork – Use boneless pork chops or pork cutlet. In a pinch you could also use bone in.</li>
        <li>Eggs – Well-beaten.</li>
        <li>Panko bread crumbs – Use panko; regular breadcrumbs aren’t the same.</li>
        <li>All-purpose flour – This helps bind the eggs and panko.</li>
        <li>Garlic salt – This gives extra added flavor.</li>
        <li>Pepper – Start with a little. You can always add more.</li>
        <li>Frying oil – Vegetable oil, peanut, avocado, and canola oil are all good choices.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Curry Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Onion – A small white, yellow, or red onion. If you can find sweet Maui onions, those are my favorite.</li>
        <li>Carrots – Peeled and cubed.</li>
        <li>Potatoes – Cut about the same size as the carrots.</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Japanese curry mix – You can find this in most supermarkets or at a specialty Asian food stores.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Tonkatsu Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat about an inch of oil in a large skillet over medium heat to medium-high heat. You could also deep fry the pork cutlets.</li>
        <li>Set up a dredging station with the beaten eggs in shallow bowls or plates, the panko in a second, and the flour in a third.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic salt and pepper to the flour and mix well with a fork.</li>
        <li>Coat the pork in flour and shake off excess. Then dip it into the beaten egg, and then into the Panko. Press the Panko onto the pork to stick well.</li>
        <li>When the oil reaches about 350F, fry the pork until golden brown. Flip it once.</li>
        <li>Remove the pork and place it on a rack or paper towel to drain.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Curry Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add oil to a large pan and cook the onion until soft.</li>
        <li>Add the carrots and potatoes and saute for 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the water and bring to a boil and simmer for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the Japanese curry roux and stir to combine. Simmer another 10 minutes or until the vegetables are tender.</li>
    </ol>
